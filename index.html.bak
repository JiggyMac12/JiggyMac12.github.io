    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      This app is used only to track cryptocurrencies. This terms of service was
      originally made on 2-25-24. Up until now there have been no changes to the
      terms. This app will be only used for the indended purposes, to help with
      tracking cryptocurrencies. The source code is avaliable on my GitHub; the
      link is in the app. The code may be downloaded for tinkering purposes, but
      it is not to be published under any circumstances. The purpose of the
      source code being avaliable is to implement extra feature(s). If I do end
      up accepting the extra feature(s), I will give credit in the app, and
      merge the fork into the main path. If this app is published against
      consent, actions will be taken against the unconcented publisher. As
      mentioned before, extra features will be acccpted and used in the app,
      with credit.
